Exile (Standard version) disassembly
====================================
Exile was written by Peter Irvin and Jeremy Smith, and was published by
Superior Software for the BBC Micro in 1988. It is a graphical adventure game
in which the player must retrieve a spaceship's destinator, which has been
stolen by a deranged scientist and hidden deep in a maze of tunnels and
caverns. The game features a procedurally generated landscape and a realistic
physics engine. It is notable for its technical complexity.

The following disassembly was created by reverse engineering binary images,
without access to any source code. It is nevertheless reasonably complete,
allowing the technical approaches used to be understood.

The author of this disassembly imposes no additional copyright restrictions
beyond those already present on the game itself. It is provided for educational
purposes only, and it is hoped that the original authors will accept it in the
good faith it was intended - as a tribute to their skills.

Technical notes
===============
This disassembly analyses the standard version of the game.

A disassembly of the game's disk protection and supervisor may be found at:
http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/exile-disk-protection-and-supervisor-disassembly.txt

A disassembly of the enhanced version of the game may be found at:
http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/exile-enhanced-disassembly.txt

The game is decrypted before use. There is extensive use of self-modifying code
throughout. The carry flag is often used in combination with shift and BIT
operations to process variables. BIT and CMP are also used as null operations
for optimised branching, which is noted in the disassembly by "(nop)".

Areas of particular interest:

&0d4d - &10cf : sprite plotting
All the sprites used in the game are generated from a 128x81 four colour bitmap
(stored at &53ec). The sprite plotting routines allow an arbitrary portion of
this bitmap to be translated into a choice of palettes and flipped horizontally
and vertically. The sixteen colours provided by the system are split into two
groups of eight - one for objects (background), and one for tiles (foreground).
These will be referred to here by upper and lower case letters respectively.

&1715 - &19a6 : landscape generation
A procedural generation algorithm is used to create a 256x256 tile landscape,
overlaid with a small amount of mapped data (stored at &4fec) for the start and
end game and areas associated with set-piece puzzles. Various positions are
indicated by the algorithm as potential places for tertiary objects.

&1a0b - &1e18 : physics engine
Objects are stored in one of three lists. The primary list has sixteen slots
for objects that are onscreen or nearly onscreen, which are processed by the
physics engine each update. The secondary list provides a further thirty-two
slots for objects whose position is remembered when offscreen. The tertiary
list stores objects that are fixed to, or emerge from, a particular location.

For example, a nest of birds is stored in the tertiary list. When the player
moves near to it, a bird may emerge, creating an object on the primary list,
and the nest is marked as having one fewer bird. Should the player teleport
away, the bird becomes offscreen. It is then removed from the primary list, and
the nest is marked a having one more bird. Similarly, a turret is promoted to
the primary list when onscreen, and unless destroyed, returned to the tertiary
list when it becomes offscreen. If the player were to drop a remote control
device or disturb a robot, these would be moved to the secondary list once they
became offscreen and remain there until they became primary again.

&1320 - &149c : sound generation
Sounds are generated using two envelopes, one for volume, one for frequency.

&27c9 - &2866 : NPC stimuli
&316b - &31ab
Many NPCs have a mood which affects their behaviour, and is in turn affected
by various stimuli. 

&6235 - &67ec : copy protection
Before starting, the game prompts for a word from the novella that accompanied
a purchased copy. If the correct word is not entered, the game starts in a demo
mode that hangs after a random period of time.

Game-play notes
===============
Invisible objects become visible under the influence of red mushrooms.

Windy caverns cease to be so once underwater.

Imps can be fed according to their type (see &317f) to yield power pods
capsules, a weapon that fires plasma balls, or active grenades.

Many creatures have a minimum energy which must be overcome in order to destroy
them. A clawed robot therefore cannot be destroyed simply by firing at it
repeatedly with an icer - a more explosive means of destruction must be found.

# Angles
# ======
# Angles are stored such that &100 = 360 degrees, starting from straight right
# at &00 and increasing clockwise. &40 = down, &80 = left, &c0 = up.
#
# calculate_vector_from_magnitude_and_angle takes an angle and a magnitude
# and converts to the x and y components of a vector.
#
# calculate_angle_from_vector takes a vector and converts to an angle and
# magnitude.
#
# Both are very approximate, but they are almost the inverse of each other:

# Envelopes
# =========
# Sound envelopes have stages, which apply the same delta to a volume or
# frequency a number of times, and loops, which repeat a set of stages.
#
# A byte with the top bit set indicates the start or end of a loop. The
# remaining bits specify the duration of the loop. A byte can end one loop
# and start another.
#
# A byte with the top bit clear indicates a stage. The remaining bits specify
# the duration of the stage. A second byte is the delta to apply at each step.
